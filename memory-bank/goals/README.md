# Project Goals

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Educational Platform

Create a comprehensive learning platform that teaches both React concepts and algorithm implementations through interactive examples.

### 2. Modern React Development

- Implement latest React 19 features
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Create reusable component library
- Implement modern UI patterns with ShadCN and Tailwind

### 3. Algorithm Visualization

- Implement 4 Binary Tree Search algorithms
- Create interactive visualizations
- Provide code examples with syntax highlighting
- Use Mermaid charts for concept demonstration

### 4. Component Architecture

- Build modular, reusable components
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
- Use modern React patterns (hooks, context, etc.)
- Create responsive and accessible UI components
