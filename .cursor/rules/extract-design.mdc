DESCRIPTION: Analyze an image of a website, and create a design-system in JSON for consistent UI development.
ANALYZE: the image pasted
OBJECTIVE: Extract a comprehensive and reusable design system from the image pasted, excluding any specific visual content, to create a JSON referenced that developers of AI systems can use as a styling foundation for consistent UI development.
INSTRUCTIONS: 
Examine the image pasted to identify the following
- Color Schemes and Palettes
- Font hierarchies and typography standards
- Spacing and margin conventions
- Structural layouts (grid systems, card designs, wrapper elements, etc.)
- Interactive elements (button styles, form inputs, data tables, etc.)
- Visual effects (corner rounding, drop shadows, and additional styling treatments)
Generate a design-system.json file that systematically documents these design principles and enabled consistent visual language reproduction. 
Save the JSON output to the /designs directory using filename design.json
REQUIREMENTS:
- **Image Analysis**: Must handle screenshots, mockups, and UI designs
- **Design Token Extraction**: Convert visual elements to CSS custom properties
- **JSON Structure**: Structure JSON with clear hierarchy and developer-accessible formatting 
- **Design System**: Follow contemporary design system best practices
- **Responsive Considerations**: Identify breakpoints and mobile-first patterns
- **Accessibility Standards**: Note contrast ratios, focus states, and semantic patterns
- **Component Patterns**: Identify reusable UI components and their variants
- **Animation Guidelines**: Extract transition timings, easing functions, and motion patterns
- **Icon System**: Document icon styles, sizes, and usage patterns
- **Form Design**: Extract input styles, validation states, and error handling
- **Navigation Patterns**: Identify menu structures, breadcrumbs, and navigation hierarchies
- **Data Visualization**: Extract chart styles, color coding, and data presentation patterns
- **Brand Consistency**: Note logo placement, brand colors, and visual identity elements
- **Cross-Platform**: Identify web, mobile, and desktop-specific design patterns
- **Performance Considerations**: Note image optimization, lazy loading, and loading states
- **Internationalization**: Extract RTL support, language-specific layouts, and cultural considerations
- **Version Control**: Track design system evolution and maintain change history
