description: We are building a Modern React and Algorithm Study guide in NextJS
techStack: 
- NextJS with Typescript
- ShadCN 2.10.0 latest - https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next
- Tailwind v4.1 latest - https://tailwindcss.com/docs - /components.json for our config
- ReactBits - From our MCP server "reactbits"
- Aceternity UI - https://pro.aceternity.com/components
- Framer Motion - for animations
- HighlightJS for Code Blocks
- Markdown Mermaid Charts - show Markdown Mermaid charts to demonstrate concepts
- pnpm - for node package management
instructions: This project was originally build for CodePen, but we need to adapt it to our NextJS app.
We will be using our memory-bank in the current project directory to track the goals and tasks for the project.
Create reusable components with ShadCN, and use ReactBits to provide modern design components and animations.

The project will have 2 main sections
- Algorithms
- React Concepts

In our algorithms route, we will explore different algorithm concepts, starting with that we have with our 4 Binary Tree Search algorithms.

Include Code Blocks to demonstrate the algorithms and react concepts with code examples.

Use Markdown Mermaid Charts to demonstrate concepts.

requirements: 
- Build Reusable Components in React, using ShadCN, Tailwind, ReactBits, Aceternity UI
- Use Motion to make the site more engaging, but don't overdo it.
- Always Use our memory-bank folder in our project directory, and the memory mcp server, to keep our project on track, by creating tasks, and following the documents located iN the memory-bank.
- Always check our package.json with fileserver MCP server to verify the version of our packages before replying to our requests
