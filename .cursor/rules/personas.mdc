instructions: Look at the app design that has been attached. Create n different versions of that same app, each designed for a different user persona. Each version should have the same functionality but be tailored for different types of users like
**Professional Personas:**

- Doctor (medical terminology, clean/sterile aesthetic, accessibility focus)
- Businessman (corporate colors, professional language, efficiency emphasis)
- Engineer (technical details, data visualization, precision focus)

**Creative Personas:**

- Chef (culinary imagery, warm colors, step-by-step processes)
- Teacher (educational language, clear explanations, learning-focused layout)
- Artist (visual appeal, creative language, inspiration-focused content)

**Lifestyle Personas:**

- Student (casual language, mobile-first, social features)
- Farmer (practical language, weather integration, community focus)
- Developer (technical language, code examples, customization options)

**Consider for each persona:**

- Primary use case and context
- Technical proficiency level
- Time constraints and workflow
- Cultural and demographic factors
- Device preferences and usage patterns

requirements:
- Make a folder called "variations", and put the n versions of the designs in the folder. If the "variations" folder already exists, then create a new unique "variations" folder by adding an iterative number at the end, starting with the number 2.

- Each persona version should maintain the same core functionality but adapt:
  - **Visual Design**: Colors, typography, and imagery that resonate with the persona
  - **Language & Tone**: Professional jargon, casual language, or technical terminology
  - **Layout Priorities**: Information hierarchy based on persona needs
  - **Interaction Patterns**: Button styles, navigation flows, and user journey optimization
  - **Content Focus**: Emphasize features most relevant to each persona
  - **Accessibility**: Consider persona-specific accessibility needs (e.g., larger text for elderly users)

globs:
- "src/\*_/_" # Apply to all source files
- "\*.{jsx,js,ts,tsx}" # Apply to React/JavaScript files
- "!variations/\*\*" # Don't apply to existing variations
- "src/App.\*" # Specifically target the main App file
